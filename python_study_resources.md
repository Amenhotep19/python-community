# Resources for Expanding Your Python Skills

If you are brand-new at programming, please check out our [beginner's guide](first_timers_guide.md). If you are already a programmer, but new to python, please check out our [python for programmers](python_for_programmers.md) guide.

## Resources

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) :wrench: :first_quarter_moon: :full_moon_with_face: Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for Python, Django, web development.
* [Test-Driven Development with Python](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754) :book: :first_quarter_moon:
* [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/) :book: :bar_chart: :beginner: :first_quarter_moon: Covers lots of Python basics with an introduction to the powerful Natural Language ToolKit (nltk). Good for intermediate programmers interested in language processing, or folks with a science / technical background who are new to Python.
* [A Guide to Python's Magic Methods](http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html) :page_facing_up: :full_moon_with_face: A thorough run-through of Python's _magic methods_ (the ones with double underscores, like `__getattr__` and `__del__`). Highly informative, but take care: with great power comes great responsibility.
* [Expert Python Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/expert-python-programming) :books: :full_moon_with_face: :moneybag: $19
* [Pro Python](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Experts-Voice-Open-Source-ebook/dp/B004VH5Z5I/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1) :books: :full_moon_with_face: :moneybag: $30 kindle, $32 paperback
* [Spyder IDE](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder#installation) :wrench: :bar_chart: :full_moon_with_face: An IDE with integrations for all of the python scientific programming libraries, e.g. scipy, numpy, matplotlib
* Writing Idiomatic Python [(Python 2.7)](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Idiomatic-Python-2-7-3-Knupp-ebook/dp/B00B5KG0F8/) [(Python 3.3+)](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Idiomatic-Python-Jeff-Knupp-ebook/dp/B00B5VXMRG/) :books: :moneybag: :first_quarter_moon: :full_moon_with_face: $8 kindle, $18 paperback, [free if you email Jeff Knupp](http://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/04/25/in-support-of-female-engineers/) (though he may be slow to respond)
* [Python Koans](https://bitbucket.org/gregmalcolm/python_koans) :pencil: :computer: :beginner: :first_quarter_moon: Python Koans help you learn better Python through testing. The Koans are puzzle-like: there are pieces of a test that need to be correctly filled in, or functionality that has tests but no code. Each teaches you about a particular Python feature or idiomatic usage.
